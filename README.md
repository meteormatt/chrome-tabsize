Extensions
===========
This project is original for chrome browser (so the name is chrome tabsize). Then i have this idea:

* we may also extend it to support firefox, safari etc.  
It deals with setting tabsize in browser.

Then i feel i'm lazy, cause i'm using chrome quite often now, lacking of power on doing others.
So the repos may also includes:

* other chrome extensions i created.

I dont want to create one repos for each extension if there will be more. So i hold everything here, if you feel it is not good, just delete others and leave what you want.


* **[browser]-tabsize**
  * _chrome-tabsize_ -- Cause google app store need $5 for developer to register, it is really hard for me. (I mean it does't accpet paypal, and register only for app store seems useless to me). And this extension is also for free using. If you want use, you need to install it by hand and by source. It is really simple, no more than 3 steps.
