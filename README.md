Chrome Tabsize
==============
This is a chrome extension for setting tabsize in chrome browser. Cause google app store need $5 for developer to register, it is really hard for me. (I mean it does't accpet paypal). And this extension is also for free using. So, if you want to use, you need to install it by hand and by source. It is really simple, no more than 3 steps.

How to install
---------------
1. download directly from github either use git clone or download zipped file. And unzip it to somewhere, for example: /somewhere/chrome-tabsize
2. go to chrome://chrome/extensions/ (or choose from menu Window -> Extenions), check on _Developer mode_, then you'll see extra buttons named _Load unpacked extensionâ€¦_. So you just click and load it from /somewhere/chrome-tabsize
3. done. config it as normal extension. 

How to use
----------
